\textbf{Exercise 14.0.1} (Market model definition). \textit{Provide the definition of the market model used by Arrow and Debreu.}\\

Consider a market model as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N=\{1, \ldots, n\}$ is the set of players;
\item $K=\{1, \ldots, k\}$ is the set of perfectly divisible commodities;
\item $x_{i} \in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{k}$ with $i \in N$ is a vector of $k$ elements, where $x_{i, j},$ denoting the element in the $j$-th position of the vector, represents the amount of commodity $j$ available to player $i$;
\item $e_{i} \in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{k}$ with $i \in N$ is the initial endowment of player $i$ and $e_{i, j}$ is the initial endowment for commodity $j$;
\item $u_{i}: \mathbb{R}_{+}^{k} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{+}$ is the utility function of player $i$ that is continuous and concave;
\item $p \in \mathbb{R}_{+}^{k}$ is a vector of $k$ elements, where $p_{j},$ denoting the element in the $j$-th position of the vector, represents the price of commodity $j$.
\end{itemize}
Each player maximizes her utility function under budget constraints by buying/selling commodities. Formally, we have:
\[
\begin{array}{cl}
\max _{x_{i}} & u_{i}\left(x_{i}\right) \\
\text { s.t. } & p \cdot x_{i} \leqslant p \cdot e_{i}
\end{array}
\]
where $p \cdot e_{i}$ represents the budget available to player $i,$ while the argument of the above optimization problem, denoted by $x_{i}^{*},$ is the best amount of commodity for player $i$ given the market prices and the budget constraints. Notice that the above optimization problem does not take into account any constraint related to the amount of commodities available in the market. Thus, in principle, the above optimization problem may return a $x_{i}^{*}$ that is not implementable in practice, requiring an excessive amount of commodities larger than that one actually available in the market.\\

\textbf{Exercise 14.0.2} (Market clearing). \textit{Provide the definition of market clearing.}\\

The market clears when the total amount of commodities $x=\sum_{i \in N} x_{i}$ equals to total amount of initial endowments $e=\sum_{i \in N} e_{i}$.\\
Notice that, when the price vector is arbitrary, there is no guarantee that the market clears. For instance, as already mentioned above, it may happen that the vector $x$ is larger than $e$ for some commodities. The market clearing property is of paramount importance and depends on the price vector. Indeed, when this property holds, each player in the market acts independently from the others. In other words, each player negotiates with a fictitious player corresponding to the market. This allows one to neglect the direct interaction between the players when searching for the market outcome.

Thus, the study of the conditions under which the market clears is crucial. This is stated by the Arrow-Debreu theorem.\\

\textbf{Exercise 14.0.3} (Arrow-Debreu equilibrium). \textit{Provide the definition of the Arrow-Debreu equilibrium and argue the meaning of the result.}\\

There is always a price vector $p^{*}$ such that $\sum_{i \in N} x_{i}^{*} \leqslant e$ and $p^{*}$ is Pareto efficient for the players.\\
The problem of finding an Arrow-Debreu equilibrium is slightly different from the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium. On the one hand, each player behaves rationally, maximizing her utility function, asin a Nash equilibrium. In particular, the problem reduces to the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium when prices are fixed. On the other hand, prices are part of the problem. Thus the problem of finding an Arrow-Debreu equilibrium can be formulated as the problem of finding prices satisfying some conditions under the equilibrium constraints of the players.Interestingly, the problem of finding an Arrow-Debreu equilibrium presents the same computational properties of the problem of finding the Nash equilibrium, as stated below.
